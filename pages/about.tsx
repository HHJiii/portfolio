          Over the past years, I have worked at a South Korean non-profit
          organization. I supported artists in all sorts of ways in leading
          creative fundraising campaigns as a project manager. Also I planned
          and operated a web service for struggling artists and local
          communities as a product manager.

          The field I am interested in is solving social problems including
          unfairness, poverty, and discrimination. I would like to design the
          world so that, regardless of their disability or difficulty, people
          can fully enjoy their life and arts without any discrimination or
          barriers.
